# Mouse-Jiggler-Mover-for-Work-PC
This script requires no admin rights, and keeps your status on Teams active
This script just moves your mouse curser 1 pixel to the right every 30 seconds and then 1 pixel to the left 30 seconds after that. 


1. Create a new Note pad (right click desktop, then NEW, then choose notepad or Text Document)

2. Copy and Paste the Script inside a Notepad or text document and name it MoveMouse.ps1 (or download MoveMouse.ps1)

3. Place the script in "My Documents"

4. Open Windows PowerShell (search PowerShell in task bar)

5. Go to My Documents directory by typing this command     cd C:\Users\********\Documents 
     Replace ***** with your username, or open file explorer and right click my documents and chose "Copy as Path" 
             If you Copied as Path you will need to delete the "        "   before entering the directory 

6. After youve navigated to My documents in PowerShell type this command to start the script     ./MoveMouse.ps1

Must keep PowerShell open (minimized is ok) but once you close PowerShell the script will stop running
